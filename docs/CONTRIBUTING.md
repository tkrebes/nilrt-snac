# Contributing to nilrt-snac

Thanks for taking an interest in contributing to [NILRT](https://github.com/ni/nilrt)'s SNAC configuration tool!

This document should provide useful information for how to get started developing, testing, and upstreaming to our mainline.


## Communications

Clone the **source** from NI's canonical upstream [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/nilrt-snac/) repo, and read the [README](https://github.com/ni/nilrt-snac/blob/master/README.md).

File **bugs** and **enhancement** requests to the canonical repo's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/ni/nilrt-snac/issues).

Send **security** concerns to the NI Security Team, per the [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ni/nilrt-snac/blob/master/docs/SECURITY.md).


## Building

`nilrt-snac` is implemented in shell scripts that do not require compilation or packaging; it does not require a build step.

See the README for installation instructions.


## Testing

`nilrt-snac` does not currently have a test suite. Please hand-test commits before contributing them to the repo, and include a summary of the testing you performed in your PR summary.


## Upstreaming Changes

nilrt-snac follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

**Base from master.** This project uses 'master' as its mainline branch ref; please base all pull requests upon that branch.

**Commit Sign-offs Required.** Please remember to sign off your commits (e.g., by using `git commit -s` if you are using the command line client). This amends your git commit message with a line of the form `Signed-off-by: Name Lastname <name.lastname@emailaddress.com>`. Please include all authors of any given commit into the commit message with a `Signed-off-by` line. This indicates that you have read and signed the Developer Certificate of Origin (see below) and are able to legally submit your code to this repository.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more details.
